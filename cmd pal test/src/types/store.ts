/**
 * Command Palette Store - The "Brain" of the Application
 *
 * Think of this store as your app's memory and messenger service.
 * It remembers what screen you're on, what you're typing, and tells
 * all your app's parts when things change so they can update themselves.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * - Components can't talk to each other directly in Chrome extensions
 * - We need one central place to remember the user's current state
 * - React components must re-render when data changes (subscriptions)
 * - Your recent commands persist even after closing Chrome
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * 1. createStore() makes our memory "bank"
 * 2. Components "subscribe" to get notified of changes
 * 3. When state changes, all subscribers automatically update
 * 4. Navigation saves breadcrumbs for the back button
